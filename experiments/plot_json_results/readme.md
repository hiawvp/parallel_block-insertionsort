# Plot generated results

`index.js` is a small (if you ignore `node_modules`) node script that reads the content of a <filename.json> experiment result file and generates a pdf plot comparing the different implementations found

## Example usage

`npm install` this may take a while depending on your node version
`node index.js ../sample_result.json`
